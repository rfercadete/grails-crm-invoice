== Introduction

{gr8crm} is a set of http://www.grails.org/[Grails Web Application Framework]
plugins that makes it easy to develop web applications with CRM functionality.

You can find more information about {gr8crm} on the main documentation site {homepage}.

=== Customer Relationship Management

Customer relationship management (CRM) is a system for managing a company’s interactions with current and future customers.
It involves using technology to organize, automate and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and technical support.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management[Wikipedia]

The {gr8crm} "Ecosystem" currently contains over 40 Grails plugins. For a complete list of plugins see {homepage}.

Each {gr8crm} plugin defines a http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[Bounded Context]
that focus on one specific domain, for example *contact*, *project* or *document*.

== Invoice Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing invoices in {gr8crm} applications.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-invoice-ui/[crm-invoice-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for managing invoices.

TIP: `crm-invoice-ui` depends on `crm-invoice` so you only need to include
`crm-invoice-ui` in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user invoice
management features.

Invoice status is mandatory on an invoice and different invoice statuses can be created with `createInvoiceStatus()`.

=== Create a new invoice

[source,groovy]
.CreateInvoice.groovy
----
def s = crmInvoiceService.createInvoiceStatus(name: "Created", true)
def t = crmInvoiceService.createPaymentTerm(name: "14days", true)

def invoice = crmInvoiceService.createInvoice(invoiceStatus: s, paymentTerm: t, customer: "ACME Inc.", customerTel: "+4685551234", customerEmail: "customer@acme.com")
crmInvoiceService.addInvoiceItem(invoice, [orderIndex: 1, productNumber: "iPhone6s", productName: "iPhone 6s 64GB Space Grey",
    unit: "item", quantity: 1, price: 699, vat: 0.2])
invoice.save(failOnError: true)

println "Invoice number #$invoice created for ${invoice.customer}"
